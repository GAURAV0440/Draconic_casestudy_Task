1.I forgot to use the full object (not just the value) in evaluation, which gave an error. Fixed it by storing the full result object.
2.The consistency check between tier and priority failed at first — because I was comparing strings instead of objects.
3. Routing agent didn’t recognize some keywords like “feature” and “request” in the beginning. Had to add them manually.
4. I was not sure what “prompt iteration” meant — but later wrote the steps of my thought process in the chat history file.
5. Accuracy for priority labels is still not perfect (60%)
6. had to double-check which Python version to use — first tried 3.13 but switched to 3.10 for compatibility.
7. Didn’t have time to do the optional video yet — may record it later if needed.
