# AI Chat History – Gaurav Chawla

[1] Project Understanding:
- I read the instructions and chose Option A: Customer Support Ticket Analyzer.
- The task was to create at least 2 agents that analyze and route support tickets.

[2] Initial Setup:
- Created project folders and files (agents, evaluation, docs, main.py)
- Made a virtual environment using Python 3.10.
- Installed libraries: pydantic, openai, tqdm, colorama, dotenv.

[3] Priority Agent:
- Built an agent that decides ticket urgency based on:
  - customer tier
  - monthly revenue
  - issue keywords
  - previous tickets
- Output priority as: low, medium, high or critical.

[4] Routing Agent:
- Made a second agent that routes tickets to the right team:
  - security, dev, support, product, account, escalation
- Used keywords from subject/message to decide team.

[5] Testing:
- Added 5 test tickets from the assignment PDF.
- Created `test_cases.py` and used them in `main.py`.

[6] Evaluation Metrics:
- Created accuracy, tier-priority consistency, and distribution checks.
- Wrote them in evaluation/metrics.py.

[7] Final Integration:
- Updated main.py to run both agents on all test cases.
- Printed results and metrics clearly.

[8] Documentation:
- Wrote README.md to explain everything.
- Wrote what didn’t work in writeup.md.
- Saved this AI chat history here.

[9] Result:
- Project is tested, working correctly, and ready to submit.
